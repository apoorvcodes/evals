# Pixa Evals: Model Evaluation Framework for Child-Safe AI (Ages 5-10)

An advanced benchmarking system designed to assess and compare AI language models for child-friendly interactions with 5-10 year olds, ensuring safe and developmentally appropriate digital experiences.

## Overview

This framework provides comprehensive testing to evaluate AI models on their ability to interact safely and effectively with children. Using OpenAI's o1-preview as the evaluation engine, it analyzes models across five key dimensions:

- üß† Intelligence (IQ) - Assesses knowledge, reasoning, and problem-solving abilities
- ‚ù§Ô∏è Emotional Intelligence (EQ) - Measures empathy, social awareness, and emotional understanding  
- üìö Educational Value - Evaluates learning outcomes and teaching effectiveness
- üé® Creativity - Rates imaginative thinking and engaging interactions
- üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Privacy - Validates content filtering and child protection measures

## Key Features

- Real-time parallel evaluation of multiple AI models
- Context-aware testing incorporating:
  - Age-appropriate content and language
  - Child development milestones
  - Individual interests and learning styles
  - Educational objectives
- Detailed performance analytics and reporting
- Easy-to-use command line interface
- Flexible scoring system with both objective and subjective metrics
- Customizable evaluation parameters

## Roadmap

- Standalone Conversation Benchmarks
  - Evaluate fabricated child-AI dialogues in isolation
  - Assess conversation consistency and coherence
  - Measure contextual memory and relationship building
  - Score natural dialogue flow and age-appropriate responses
  - Analyze conversation safety across multiple exchanges
  - Compare models on extended interaction capabilities
